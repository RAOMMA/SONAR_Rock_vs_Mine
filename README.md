# Sonar-Rock-vs-Mine

## Overview

This project is a machine-learning classification task that aims to make a classification between rock and mine on certain rock/mine-related features. It utilizes a pre-trained logistic regression model to make predictions.

## Dataset

- **Dataset Name**:Sonar-Rock-vs-Mine
- **Data Source**:  upload on git.
- The dataset contains the following attributes:
  - Feature columns (61): Numerical values representing various rock/mine-related features.
  - Target column: Binary variable (Rock, Mine).

## Project Structure

- `README.md`: Documentation of the project.
- `main.py`: Python script for making diabetes predictions.
- `logistic_regression_model.pkl`: Pre-trained logistic regression model for Rock vs mine classification.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```shell
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Sonar-Rock-vs-Mine
Create a virtual environment (recommended) and install the required dependencies:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have the pre-trained logistic regression model ('logistic_regression_model.pkl') in the same directory as the script ('diabetes_prediction.py').
Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
Run the script with the --value argument followed by a comma-separated list of feature values that you want to classify.
## For example:
python diabetes_prediction.py --value "6,148,72,35,0,33.6,0.627,50"

Follow the instructions in the script to make predictions.

## Model Training
The project uses a logistic regression model to classify individuals into two classes: diabetes and no diabetes. The pre-trained model is saved as 'logistic_regression_model.pkl'.

## Evaluation
The script provides binary predictions. You can evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results
The project provides predictions for Rock vs mine based on the input features. The performance of the model may vary depending on the dataset used.

## Future Improvements
There are several ways to improve the model and the project:

Explore more advanced machine learning techniques.
Fine-tune hyperparameters for better model performance.
Gather more labeled data for improved accuracy.
